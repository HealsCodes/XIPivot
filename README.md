## About

XIPivot is an addon that allows to dynamically override parts of the ROM and sound
files of your FFXI client without touching the actual files.

It provides support for multiple overlay directories as well as runtime controls
of which overlays are loaded and used by the game.

The goals behind XIPivot are simple:

- no modifications to the original DAT / spw or bgw files
- no more huge folder with thousands of anonymous files
- the ability to sort Mods into separate folders for each mod
- the ability to control which Mods take precedence

## Compatibility

XIPivot works together with [Ashita v3](https://www.ashitaxi.com), [Windower 4](http://www.windower.net) as well as
the current beta version of [Ashita v4](https://github.com/AshitaXI/Ashita-v4beta).

## Disclaimer

I tested XIPivot to the best of my capabilities but I can not guarantee that it works without bugs for 100% of the time.
Use at your own discretion, I take no responsibility for any client crashes or data loss.
